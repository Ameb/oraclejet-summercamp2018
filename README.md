# Oracle Jet

This is Oracle Jet training based on what we did in Oracle Summer Camp 2018. Go to the `TRAINING.md` and you can follow the instructions. Also there are public in this github link: [https://github.com/geertjanw/ojet-training/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/geertjanw/ojet-training/blob/master/README.md)
The Code is resolve in this folder, but is not complete, remains the internationalization: [https://github.com/geertjanw/ojet-training/tree/master/result](https://github.com/geertjanw/ojet-training/tree/master/result)
Also there is a fix on the CRUD part updating the salary, because it expect a number and you are passing a string, check the `self.updateFields` inside `dashboard.js` to check it.
